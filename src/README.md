# Python script for 4620 project database creation

- Steps to run:

  1. Run 4620gui.py with `python3 4620gui.py`
  2. Enter user information. The database will be created if it doesn't exist, 
     or it will warn you about it being already created. 
     Either will work with the rest of the process.
  3. Main screen will open after seed data loaded. If the 
  data is already there, there will be warnings, but nothing
  will be affected.
